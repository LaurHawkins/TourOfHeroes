1. create new project for hero
2. within that folder, initialize a new repository locally
   You don't go to github
   proj-folder>git init
   This allows to push stage to the local git on your machine
3. Push to github - you have to add a remmte repository
   3.1 go to github and create new repository, 
       It shows local steps 
       We'll do the second steps this time (since we already created it locally 
        this time). The URL is the URL for github.
       You are adding existing repository (it exists on local from above steps).
       This is better.

   3.2 If you push before you do remote, from VS Code, you can create a public or private repo. 
4. Ready to do commit, VS Code left source control, Name it, Commit, Push
